## General info

Our project, "Sprout Spy", is an application that will help new or future gardeners understand what kinds of seeds and cuttings can be planted in their local
planting zone, as well as search for local public gardens for those who do not have planting space in their area. Our application will also display the day's current weather to plan your trip to your local garden accordingly.

```
GIVEN I am using the Sprout Spy website to learn how to garden, 
WHEN I open the Sprout Spy website, 
THEN i see a a welcome modal that lightens the mood of anxious future gardeners.
WHEN I click an answer for the modal, 
THEN I see the Openweathermaps header, and google maps API to search for local gardens and local planting zone information.
WHEN I enter a zip code in the search bar,
THEN I see with the results for the corresponding agricultural zone as well as local gardens.
WHEN I click to see results,
THEN I am taken to the results page that lists plants I can grow in my zone.

THEN I can add a plant to the database.
