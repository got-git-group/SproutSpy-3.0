## General info

Our project, "Sprout Spy", is an application that will help new or future gardeners understand what kinds of seeds and cuttings can be planted in their local
planting zone, as well as search for local public gardens for those who do not have planting space in their area. Our application will also display the day's current weather to plan your trip to your local garden accordingly.


<ins>User Story</ins>

```
AS A novice gardener
I WANT: -to know what plants I can grow near me,
        -to learn the basic planting requirements for each plant
        -to sign up as a new user or login, in order to edit or delete a plant in the database
SO THAT: I can garden with confidence
```
<ins>Acceptance Criteria</ins>

```
GIVEN I am using the Sprout Spy website to learn how to garden, 
WHEN I open the Sprout Spy website, 
THEN I see a drop down menu to select my USDA zone.
WHEN I click a zone, 
THEN I see a results page filled with plants that I can grow in my zone, with details about each plant.
WHEN I click View Plant on a plant result,
THEN a new page opens with more details of that plant. If I am logged in I may edit or delete the plant.
WHEN I click to see results,
THEN I am taken to the results page that lists plants I can grow in my zone.
WHEN I log in or sign up,
THEN the navigation bar changes and when viewing a plant I can edit or remove a plant in the database.
